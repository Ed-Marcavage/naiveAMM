# AMM Trading Functions Explanation

## `getInputAmountBasedOnOutput`
- **Purpose**: Used when a user wants to buy a specific amount of token Y and needs to know how much of token X is required. 
- **Description**: This function is about purchasing a fixed amount of the output with variable input. It's used to calculate the necessary amount of token X to buy a predetermined amount of token Y.

## `getOutputAmountBasedOnInput`
- **Purpose**: Used when a user is willing to sell or spend a specific amount of token X and wants to find out how much of token Y they will get. 
- **Description**: This function is about selling or converting a fixed input for a variable amount of output. It determines how much of token Y will be received in exchange for a given amount of token X.

# Understanding the Inverse Relationship

## Constant Product Formula Basis
Both functions operate based on the principle that the product of the reserves of two tokens in a liquidity pool must remain constant after a trade. This is mathematically expressed as:
$$ X \times Y = K $$
where \(X\) and \(Y\) are the reserves of the two tokens, and \(K\) is a constant.

## Effect of a Trade
- When token \(X\) is added to the pool (increased by \(dx\)), token \(Y\) must decrease by \(dy\) to maintain the constant product \(K\).
- Conversely, to increase \(Y\) by \(dy\), \(X\) must decrease by \(dx\).

## How Each Function Works

### `getOutputAmountBasedOnInput`
- **Mathematical Operation**: Given an increase \(dx\) in \(X\), it calculates the required decrease \(dy\) in \(Y\) to keep \(K\) constant.
- **Formula**: 
  $$ dy = \frac{Y \times dx}{X + dx} $$
  This formula derives from solving the equation:
  $$ (X + dx) \times (Y - dy) = K $$
  for \(dy\).

### `getInputAmountBasedOnOutput`
- **Mathematical Operation**: Given a desired decrease \(dy\) in \(Y\), it calculates how much \(X\) must increase by \(dx\) to maintain \(K\).
- **Formula**: 
  $$ dx = \frac{X \times dy}{Y - dy} $$
  This is derived by rearranging the same constant product equation but solving for \(dx\) instead, ensuring that:
  $$ (X + dx) \times (Y - dy) = K $$

## Why the Inverse Nature?
- **Inverse Problems**: Each function addresses the inverse problem of the other:
  - `getOutputAmountBasedOnInput` calculates the output decrease based on an input increase.
  - `getInputAmountBasedOnOutput` calculates the input increase required for a desired output decrease.
- **Trading Intent**:
  - **Buying vs. Selling**:
    - `getOutputAmountBasedOnInput` reflects a trading scenario where the trader knows how much they want to spend and needs to know what they will get.
    - `getInputAmountBasedOnOutput` suits a scenario where the trader knows what they want to receive and needs to find out what it will cost them.

## Conclusion
The different mathematical formulas used in these functions reflect their roles in handling the bidirectional nature of trades within liquidity pools governed by the CPF. By having both functions, AMMs can efficiently facilitate trades regardless of whether users are entering the trade with a fixed amount they wish to spend or a fixed amount they hope to receive. This dual functionality underpins the flexibility and robustness of AMMs in maintaining liquidity and providing continuous market pricing.
